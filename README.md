Here is your **full, production-ready `README.md`** file for the `massa-base` project, using your Windows setup (`massa-node.exe`, `massa-client.exe`) and actual folder path (`C:\Users\mwesh845\Downloads\massa_MAIN.3.0_release_windows`).

### ✅ Final `README.md` — `massa-base` (for Windows Executables)

```markdown
# massa-base

**massa-base** is a foundational environment for running, testing, and interacting with the [Massa Blockchain](https://massa.net) locally on Windows. This project uses the official `massa-node.exe` and `massa-client.exe` binaries to simulate a working blockchain node and client interface for smart contracts, staking, and wallet operations.

---

## 📁 Project Location

This setup is located at:

```

C:\Users\mwesh845\Downloads\massa\_MAIN.3.0\_release\_windows

```

You may rename this folder to `massa-base` for consistency, especially if pushing to GitHub.

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. ✅ Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11
- Git (optional, for version control): https://git-scm.com
- Massa release binaries (already included)
- Optional: VS Code or any text editor

---

### 2. 🟢 Start the Massa Node

Open **PowerShell** or **Command Prompt** and run:

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\mwesh845\Downloads\massa_MAIN.3.0_release_windows"
.\massa-node.exe
````

This starts your Massa node and begins syncing with the network.

---

### 3. 💬 Open the Massa Client (in a second terminal)

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\mwesh845\Downloads\massa_MAIN.3.0_release_windows"
.\massa-client.exe
```

You’ll be greeted with a prompt:

```
>>>
```

You can now enter Massa CLI commands to interact with your node and wallet.

## 💡 Common Massa Client Commands

| Command                                       | Description                      |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `help`                                        | View all available commands      |
| `wallet_info`                                 | Show wallet address and balances |
| `get_status`                                  | See node sync status             |
| `send_transaction <from> <to> <amount> <fee>` | Transfer tokens                  |
| `buy_rolls <address> <amount> <period>`       | Stake rolls                      |
| `execute_sc ...`                              | Deploy a smart contract          |
| `exit`                                        | Close the client                 |

Try `help` inside the client to explore more commands.

## 🔐 Wallet Details

A wallet is automatically created in the `wallet/` directory. To check your wallet:

```bash
>>> wallet_info
```

> ⚠️ Keep your wallet folder safe — it contains your private keys.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

All configuration files are in the `config/` folder. You can customize:

* `config.toml`: General settings (e.g. logging, ports, RPC)
* `bootstrap_list.json`: Bootstrap peers to connect to
* `peers.json`: List of known peers

You can also enable API and JSON-RPC connections by updating `config.toml`:

```toml
[api]
enable = true
bind = "127.0.0.1:33035"
```

---

## 🌐 Optional: Connect Frontend via JSON-RPC

If you're building a frontend (like a DeFi dApp), you can connect to your local Massa node using the enabled JSON-RPC port.

Example:

```http
POST http://127.0.0.1:33035
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "get_addresses",
  "params": [],
  "id": 1
}
```

Use tools like Postman or connect using JavaScript via `fetch`.

---

## 📦 Use Cases

* Deploy and test Massa smart contracts
* Manage local wallets and perform transactions
* Stake rolls and simulate validator behavior
* Build full-stack dApps using Massa and JSON-RPC
* Prepare for deployment to testnet or mainnet

---

## 📘 Tips

* Always open **two terminal windows** — one for the node and one for the client.
* Ensure your firewall/antivirus isn’t blocking `massa-node.exe` or `massa-client.exe`.
* Use a text editor to safely edit `config.toml` if needed.
